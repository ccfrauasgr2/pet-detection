# Automatic Pet Detection With Edge Computing

## Project Objective

The goal is to develop an edge computing solution for the automatic detection of pets (cats, dogs, golden hamster). Details are listed [here](https://www.christianbaun.de/CGC23/index.html).

General steps to achieve the project goal:
- Set up a Sensor Node (Raspberry4) with Camera Modules
- Train a Model to Detect Pets
- Deploy the Trained Model on the Sensor Node
- Set up a Cluster of Raspberry3 Nodes
- Set up on the Cluster a Database for Storing Detection Results 
- Develop on the Cluster a WebApp for Displaying Detection Results
- Develop API Connection Between the Sensor Node, Cluster & WebApp
- Test Full System
