# Project Documentation

## Overview

**Objective**: The project *Automatic Pet Detection With Edge Computing* aims to develop an edge computing solution for the automatic detection of cats, dogs, golden hamster. Detailed requirements are listed [here](https://www.christianbaun.de/CGC23/index.html). General steps to achieve the project goal are:
- Set up a Sensor Node (Raspberry4) with Camera Modules
- Train a Model to Detect Pets
- Deploy the Trained Model on the Sensor Node
- Set up a Cluster of Raspberry3 Nodes
- Set up on the Cluster a Database for Storing Detection Results 
- Develop on the Cluster a WebApp for Displaying Detection Results
- Develop API Connection Between the Sensor Node, Cluster & WebApp
- Test Full System

**Duration**: From 12.04.2023 to 05.07.2023

**Members**: Vincent Roßknecht, Jonas Hülsmann, Ekrem Bugday, Marco Tenderra, Minh Kien Nguyen, Alexander Atanassov
